Accurate revenue forecasting is essential for effective government budget planning. This study investigates whether the use of machine learning methods can enhance the accuracy of payroll tax and land transfer duty revenue forecasts in Victoria. We compare the performance of nine different forecasting methods, including traditional econometrics models and machine learning algorithms, based on various forecast horizons, loss functions and sample periods. We find that while machine learning methods do not improve payroll tax revenue prediction, they do marginally outperform simpler methods in forecasting land transfer duty. This study shows that machine learning methods are more effective for tax lines that have higher volatility and are more sensitive to economic fluctuations.
